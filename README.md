# CS 210 CornerGrocer Project

## Project Summary
This project reads a list of grocery items from a text file and tracks how many times each item appears. It then allows the user to search for the frequency of a specific item, display all frequencies, or view a histogram of the data. This program was created to help visualize purchase trends and could be used by a grocery store to optimize product placement.

## What I Did Well
I did well with organizing the program using clean structure and comments that explain each part of the code. The use of a `map` made frequency counting efficient and easy to maintain. I also kept the program readable and broke logic into separate functions.

## Areas for Improvement
If I continued working on this project, I would add stronger error handling for missing or corrupted files and possibly include a binary storage option for faster lookup. I could also allow multi-word item names if needed. These improvements would make the program more robust and flexible.

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them
The most challenging part was handling file input and preventing the program from crashing if the file was missing or formatted incorrectly. I used exception handling and careful checking of the file stream to fix this. I also became more comfortable using version control with GitHub during this process.

## Transferable Skills
This project strengthened my understanding of file I/O, data structures, and debugging in C++. These skills are very transferable to other programming languages and future projects that involve data analysis or input validation.

## Maintainability and Readability
I made the program maintainable by using clear variable names, modular functions, and meaningful comments. Someone else reading the code would be able to understand the logic quickly and modify it if needed.
